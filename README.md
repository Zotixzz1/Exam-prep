finish functional requirements (what the system should do) and non functional requirements 

task b

visual interface design

wireframes with annotations (do low and high fidelity)

mood boards and style guides - show fonts, font colour, font size, proposed logos, colour samples (include hex codes), selection of images, show them in asset log

decomposition coverage

navigation maps - show how user navigates through links starting from the home page, explain purpose of each site

diagram to show data exchange between front end and back end systems, differentiate between front end and back end needs

algorithms

flowchart, pseudocode, and data flow diagrams 

create separate flowchart and pseudocode showing key calculations and total cost of order.

create separate flowchart and pseudocode showing handling user access, setting up an account, logging in, changing password

the data requirements 

data dictionaries with error handling process which could be:
- [ ] data validation rules (email verification, password validation, hashing password)
- [ ] input masks
- [ ] type casting 
- [ ] feedback to user/error message
- [ ] limiting field/variable length

format:
field name
data type
data format
description
example

do for:
log in
consultations
buy page

after write about error handling

ERD diagrams showing:
- [ ] PKS
- [ ] FKS
- [ ] fields 
- [ ] relationship types

data flow diagrams

static and dynamic model diagrams 

test strategy

format:
date of test
component to be tested
type of test to be carried out


show how you will test your digital solution

show functional, non functional, and front end testing

show the transition between unit testing and integration testing

show how the correct data form may impact on the component being tested

show how the incorrect data form may impact on the component being tested

show the types of testing required:
- [ ] acceptance testing
- [ ] alpha testing
- [ ] beta testing
- [ ] black box testing
- [ ] white box testing 
- [ ] unit and integration testing maybe???

show the order that components should be tested
