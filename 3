The stronger student has successfully developed a prototype and deployed various tools to
collect high-quality feedback on different system elements. This satisfactory performance
has allowed for a constructive feedback loop that consistently offers opportunities for
evidence-based improvements.

Their approach to gathering feedback shows that the student knows the value of continuous
evaluation and the role of end-user experience in system development. The application of
various tools has proven successful in facilitating the capture of high-quality feedback,
demonstrating their competent understanding of user experience testing methods.

The feedback collected has consistently provided the student with valuable insight, driving
iterative improvements to the prototype. Their capability to integrate feedback and iterative
on their work underscores a vital strength in modern development environmentsadaptability. 
The students focus on evidence-informed enhancements displays a
commendable commitment to data-driven decision-making and a deep understanding of
the iterative development process.

This is an example of a weaker student. They have attempted to create a prototype
incorporating some mechanisms for gathering feedback, although these still need to capture
high-quality insights effectively. This preliminary step demonstrates an initial understanding
of the importance of user feedback in system development, but there is room for significant
improvement.

The tools used by the student in their current approach have resulted in feedback of only
adequate quality. This suggests that their understanding of the role of end-user experience
in system development is in its early stages. Further refinement of their feedback-gathering
methods could result in more insightful and actionable input.

The quality of feedback collected thus far indicates that the student may need to understand
better and implement practical tools and strategies to gather detailed user responses.
Focusing on this area would likely lead to more comprehensive feedback and, thus, more
precise direction for improvements to their prototype.
